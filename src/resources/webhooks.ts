   * ## Event Types
   *
   * Available event types to subscribe to:
   *
   * - `match.completed` - Fired when a football match ends
   * - `team_member.transferred` - Fired when a player/coach joins or leaves a team
   *
   * If no event types are specified, the webhook will receive all event types.
   *
   * ## Webhook Signatures
   *
   * All webhook deliveries include Standard Webhooks signature headers:
   *
   * - `webhook-id` - Unique message identifier
   * - `webhook-timestamp` - Unix timestamp of when the webhook was sent
   * - `webhook-signature` - HMAC-SHA256 signature in format `v1,{base64_signature}`
   *
   * Store the returned `secret` securely - you'll need it to verify webhook
   * signatures.

   * 2. Find all webhooks subscribed to that event type
   * 3. Send a POST request to each webhook URL with signature headers
   * 4. Return the delivery results
   *
   * ## Event Payload
   *
   * You can provide a custom payload, or leave it empty to use a sample payload.
   *
   * ## Webhook Signature Headers
   *
   * Each webhook delivery includes:
   *
   * - `webhook-id` - Unique event identifier (e.g., `evt_abc123...`)
   * - `webhook-timestamp` - Unix timestamp
   * - `webhook-signature` - HMAC-SHA256 signature (`v1,{base64}`)
   *
   * To verify signatures, compute:
   *
   * ```
   * signature = HMAC-SHA256(
   *     key = base64_decode(secret_without_prefix),
   *     message = "{timestamp}.{raw_json_payload}"
