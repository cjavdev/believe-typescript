   * The request body is a **union type (oneOf)** - you must include the

   *
   * - `"member_type": "player"` - Creates a player (requires position,
   *   jersey_number, etc.)
   * - `"member_type": "coach"` - Creates a coach (requires specialty, etc.)
   * - `"member_type": "medical_staff"` - Creates medical staff (requires medical
   *   specialty, etc.)
   * - `"member_type": "equipment_manager"` - Creates equipment manager (requires
   *   responsibilities, etc.)
   *
   * The `character_id` field references an existing character from
   * `/characters/{id}`.
   *
   * **Example for creating a player:**
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "member_type": "player",
   *   "character_id": "sam-obisanya",
   *   "team_id": "afc-richmond",
